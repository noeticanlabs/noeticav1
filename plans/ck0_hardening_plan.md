# CK-0 Hardening Plan: Addressing Four Pressure Points

**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Status:** Draft  
**Scope:** Hardening Phase 0 / CK-0 mathematical specification against hostile review

---

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the four "pressure points" identified in the skeptical systems review that could compromise CK-0's mathematical defensibility. Each pressure point represents a gap where a hostile reviewer could attack the specification's rigor.

**The reviewer has provided precise mathematical spec language - this plan incorporates that spec and prepares for implementation.**

| Pressure Point | Current State | Target State | Priority |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Units Discipline | Implicit unit compatibility | Explicit unit declaration or conversion map | HIGH |
| Local vs Global Lipschitz | "Exists L ≥ 0" (unspecified domain) | Global domain OR piecewise-certified Lipschitz | HIGH |
| Contract Activation Semantics | Applicability predicate A_k(x) underspecified | Explicit activation change handling | MEDIUM |
| E_k Discipline | E_k ≥ 0 with optional Ē | Explicit disturbance policy (DP0/DP1/DP2/DP3) | HIGH |

## REVIEWER-PROVIDED SPEC LANGUAGE (CANONICAL)

The following three sections contain the **exact mathematical spec language** that should be added to CK-0 documentation. These are written in spec-ready form.

---

## A) Disturbance Policy (CK-0 Canon Addendum)

### A.1 Disturbance Separation Rule (non-negotiable)

CK-0 uses disturbance-separated servicing:

$$D_{k+1} \le D_k - S(D_k,B_k) + E_k$$

**Rule:** Φ (equivalently S) MUST NOT include disturbance. All exogenous effects MUST be accounted for solely in E_k. This prevents double-counting and closes the "hidden slack" loophole.

### A.2 Disturbance Policy Classes (must declare exactly one)

Every CK-0 run MUST declare a `disturbance_policy_id` selecting one of:

#### (DP0) Zero-disturbance

$$E_k \equiv 0$$

Verifier assumes E_k=0 and rejects receipts that log any E_k>0. Use this for purely symbolic/runtime kernels and deterministic benchmarks.

#### (DP1) Uniform bounded disturbance

There exists a declared Ē ≥ 0 such that:

$$0 \le E_k \le \bar{E} \quad \forall k$$

Verifier checks E_k ≤ Ē each step.

#### (DP2) Event-typed disturbance bounds

There exists a finite event type set 𝒯 and bound map:

$$\beta : \mathcal T \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$$

Each step declares an optional disturbance event (t_k ∈ 𝒯 ∪ {∅}), and:

$$0 \le E_k \le \beta(t_k)$$

with β(∅)=0. Verifier checks event id + bound.

#### (DP3) Model-based disturbance (advanced; optional)

Disturbance is generated by a declared deterministic map:

$$E_k = \mathcal{E}(x_k,u_k;\theta)$$

with fixed parameters θ and canonical arithmetic. Verifier recomputes E_k exactly. Use this only when you need "computed disturbance" (sensor noise models, discretization error estimators) without sacrificing replay.

### A.3 Receipt obligations for disturbance

Every step receipt MUST include:
- `disturbance_policy_id`
- `E_k`
- if DP2: `disturbance_event_id` (or null)
- if DP1: `E_bar`
- if DP3: `E_model_id` + parameter hash

**Anti-vacuity rule:** If DP1/DP2/DP3 is used, the bound/model MUST be declared upfront (policy header) and hash-committed. No per-step "new excuses."

---

## B) CK-0 as a Constrained Semigroup with Scalar Field

### B.1 Extended state and admissible action stream

Let:
- X be the typed state space.
- D ∈ ℝ_{≥0} be the debt scalar.

Define extended state:

$$Y := X \times \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0} \quad\text{with}\quad y_k = (x_k, D_k)$$

An action step consists of:

$$a_k := (u_k, B_k, E_k)$$

where:
- u_k is the transition descriptor,
- B_k ≥ 0 budget,
- E_k ≥ 0 disturbance, constrained by the disturbance policy.

### B.2 Deterministic state evolution operator

There exists a deterministic transition map:

$$T : X \times U \to X$$

so:

$$x_{k+1} = T(x_k, u_k)$$

### B.3 Debt evolution as a constrained scalar cocycle

Define violation functional:

$$V : X \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$$

and debt:

$$D_k := V(x_k)$$

CK-0 imposes the inequality constraint:

$$V(x_{k+1}) \le V(x_k) - S(V(x_k), B_k) + E_k$$

Equivalently, define the *admissible evolution relation* ℛ ⊆ Y × A × Y by:

$$(x,D)\xrightarrow{(u,B,E)}(x',D')$$

iff
- x' = T(x,u),
- D = V(x),
- D' = V(x'),
- and the CK-0 law holds.

This is a **constrained semigroup**: composition of admissible steps is admissible provided receipts verify and policies remain fixed.

### B.4 Semigroup property (engine-agnostic statement)

Let a_{0:n-1} be an action sequence obeying the fixed CK-0 policies. Define the composed evolution:

$$\mathcal{T}_{a_{0:n-1}} := T(\cdot,u_{n-1})\circ\cdots\circ T(\cdot,u_0)$$

Then CK-0 coherence of the run is exactly:
- the existence of a chain (y_0 → y_1 → ⋯ → y_n) in ℛ,
- verified via the hash-chained receipt sequence.

So CK-0 is: **a semigroup of deterministic state operators with a constrained scalar cocycle** (D_k=V(x_k)) that must satisfy the law under replay.

## C) Minimal Conditions for Global Asymptotic Coherence Under Nonlinear Servicing

We derive the "smallest honest" conditions under which D_k → 0 (or to a bound) for general nonlinear S.

We work with the canonical law:

$$D_{k+1} \le D_k - S(D_k,B_k) + E_k$$

with:
- D_k ≥ 0,
- 0 ≤ S(D,B) ≤ D,
- S monotone non-decreasing in D and B,
- disturbance policy DP0/DP1/DP2/DP3.

### C.1 Bounded-debt theorem (global; minimal)

Assume:
1. E_k ≤ Ē (DP1/DP2/DP3 implies this via bound).
2. There exists B_min > 0 and α ∈ (0,1) such that for all D ≥ 0:

   $$S(D, B) \ge (1-\alpha)D \quad \text{whenever } B \ge B_{\min}.$$

   Equivalently,

   $$D - S(D,B) \le \alpha D \quad (B \ge B_{\min}).$$

Then whenever B_k ≥ B_min for all sufficiently large k:

$$\limsup_{k\to\infty} D_k \le \frac{\bar E}{1-\alpha}.$$

This is the engine-agnostic stability envelope, and it holds for nonlinear S.

### C.2 Asymptotic coherence to zero (DP0, no disturbance)

Assume DP0: E_k ≡ 0.

Minimal sufficient condition for D_k → 0 is: **uniform fractional service eventually**.

There exists B_min > 0 and η ∈ (0,1) such that for all D > 0:

$$S(D,B) \ge \eta D \quad \text{whenever } B \ge B_{\min}.$$

If B_k ≥ B_min for all sufficiently large k, then:

$$D_{k+1} \le (1-\eta)D_k \quad\Rightarrow\quad D_k \to 0 \text{ exponentially.}$$

This is the clean "global asymptotic coherence" condition.

### C.3 Asymptotic coherence with vanishing disturbance

If E_k → 0 (or Σ_k E_k < ∞), and the same fractional service condition holds eventually, then:

$$D_k \to 0.$$

A standard sufficient condition:
- DP2 with event schedule that eventually stops disturbances,
- or DP3 where modeled error decays under refinement.

### C.4 "Integral" condition (weaker, more general)

If you can't guarantee uniform fractional service, you can still get convergence if service is **persistently positive** away from zero.

Assume DP0 and:

For every ε > 0, there exists s_ε > 0 such that:

$$S(D,B_{\min}) \ge s_\varepsilon \quad \forall D \ge \varepsilon.$$

Then debt cannot stall above ε. It must eventually enter [0, ε]. Since ε is arbitrary:

$$D_k \to 0.$$

This is a minimal "no-flat-plateaus" condition on S.

### C.5 Necessary condition (what must be true)

If DP0 and D_k → 0 for all initial debts, then it is necessary that:

$$S(D,B_{\min}) > 0 \quad \forall D>0$$

for some persistent budget level B_min that occurs infinitely often.

If S(D,B)=0 on any interval D ∈ (ε, M) for the budgets you actually use, the system can get stuck there forever. No theorem can save you.

### C.6 What CK-0 should record for these theorems to apply

To make these convergence claims auditable, CK-0 receipts/policy headers must pin:
- whether DP0/DP1/DP2/DP3 is active,
- bounds Ē (or event bounds),
- a service envelope certificate, e.g.:
  - α and B_min such that D-S(D,B) ≤ αD for B ≥ B_min,
  - or a declared S(D,B_min) ≥ s_ε schedule (less common).

This is how "math claims" become "verifier-checkable claims."

## Practical Canonical Choice (What to Freeze for v1.0)

For CK-0 v1.0, freeze the **class** and **the canonical inequality**, plus one default instance:

- Canonical inequality: D_{k+1} ≤ D_k - S(D_k,B_k) + E_k
- Default service instance: S_lin(D,B) = min(D, μB)
- Disturbance policy must be DP0/DP1/DP2/DP3, explicitly chosen and hash-committed
- Optional "fractional service certificate" for kernels that want strong convergence claims

That gives conservative infrastructure *and* a path to stiff nonlinear behavior in higher kernels.
